DESCRIPTION:

        Consider a system to control a sprinkler. The purpose of this system is to adjust the operating
    time of the sprinkler (short, medium, long). The outside sensors give information about the air
    temperature (very cold, cold, normal, warm, hot) and the humidity of the soil (dry, normal, wet). Compute
    the necessary operating time of the sprinkler according to the input data.


SOLUTION:

    INPUT VARIABLES:

        - T = Temperature:
            * {verycold, cold, normal, warm, hot}
            * {x | -30 <= x <= 35}

        - H = Humidity:
            * {dry, normal, wet}
            * {x | 0 <= x <= 100}

    OUTPUT:

        - TIME (of the sprinkler):
            * {short, medium ,long}

    ALGORITHM:

        - Mamdani model:
            * consequence of rule: “output variable belongs to a fuzzy set”
            * Result of evaluation is applied for the membership function of the consequence
            * Example: if x is in A and y is in B, then z is in C

        - Defuzzification:
            * COA: Centroid Area
            * estimation of COA by using a sample of n points (xi, i=1,2,..., n) of the resulted fuzzy set
